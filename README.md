# Memory-Game
 blueprint for a memory game... UI design coming soon!

Memory Game has 8 cards, each card being blank on one side and the other side containing a 3 digit integer. There are 3 pairs of identical cards and 2 cards that are blank on both sides. 

The game begins with all cards facing down. Selecting a cell will unveil the card associated with that index. Select a second cell. If the second cell is the first selection's identical, both will stay revealed for the remainder of the game. If it is not, both cards will be face down again.

The game ends when all cards have been revealed.
